Welcome to the Artillery documentation!
***************************************

Artillery is a simple but powerful load testing toolkit. You can use it to make your application perform better under high load. Use Artillery to make your application **faster**, more **scalable**, and more **resilient**.

You can use Artillery to run tests on your dev laptop. Once you're ready to scale up your tests or run them on a schedule, Artillery can be set up on AWS or GCE. `Artillery Cloud <https://artillery.io/cloud>`_ is also available for teams that want an instant-on managed solution.

If you're new to Artillery, `Getting Started <gettingstarted.html>`_ is a good place to start, followed by a basic overview of `how Artillery works <basicconcepts.html>`_. Then when you're writing your tests, the various references (`HTTP <testing_http.html>`_, `Socket.io <testing_socketio.html>`_, `WebSockets <testing_websockets.html>`_, `Script <script_reference.html>`_, and `CLI <cli_reference.html>`_) may come in handy.

Happy load testing!
